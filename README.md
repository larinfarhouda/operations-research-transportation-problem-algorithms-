# operations research (transportation problem algorithms)

This repo contains transportation problems calculators using 4 algorithms:

## MODI METHOD 
The modified distribution method, is also known as MODI method or (u - v) method provides a minimum cost solution to the transportation problems. MODI method is an improvement over stepping stone method. This model studies the minimization of the cost of transporting a commodity from a number of sources to several destinations. The supply at each source and the demand at each destination are known. The objectives are to develop and review an integral transportation schedule that meets all demands from the inventory at a minimum total transportation cost. 


## HUNGARIAN METHOD
The Hungarian method is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time and which anticipated later primalâ€“dual methods.



## THE NORTH-WEST CORNER
The North-West Corner Rule is a method adopted to compute the initial feasible solution of the transportation problem. The name North-west corner is given to this method because the basic variables are selected from the extreme left corner.



## BIG-M METHOD 
In operations research, the Big M method is a method of solving linear programming problems using the simplex algorithm. The Big M method extends the simplex algorithm to problems that contain "greater-than" constraints.
